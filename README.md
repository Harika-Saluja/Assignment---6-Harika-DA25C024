## Assignment 6 - Data Analytics Lab

#### Documentation: 
##### This assignment focuses on understanding and handling missing data problems in real-world datasets through imputation and regression techniques.
##### Using the UCI Credit Card Default Clients Dataset, the task demonstrates how different imputation methods affect the performance of a classification model, thereby highlighting the trade-offs between data cleaning strategies and model accuracy.

##### The assignment involves implementing three imputation techniques — simple (median), linear regression, and non-linear regression — and comparing them against a listwise deletion approach. The ultimate goal is to evaluate which strategy best preserves the predictive power of the dataset when training a Logistic Regression classifier.

#### Key tasks completed in this assignment:
    - Artificially introduced Missing At Random (MAR) values
    - Implemented 3 imputation techniques - simple, linear and non-linear regression
    - Analyzed all the results

### Folder Structure
- `Assignment_6.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook with all solutions
- `UCI_Credit_Card.csv` -> file of the dataset
- `UCI_Credit_Card_MAR.csv` -> file of the dataset
- `UCI_Credit_Card_MedianImputed.csv` -> Dataset A
